Quick little java program to make a review for a test. Just supply the text file in the format "question.answer" per line. 
This will give instant feedback on whether the question was right/wrong as well as the percentage. Only deletes the questions that were answered correctly. Able to cheat by knowing any letter of the answer, but this is supposed to be a study tool so I choose using contains() method over having to put in the whole answer if it was too long.
